# SplitnAss

A web app to enter and calculate scores for the german card game [Doppelkopf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelkopf).

Over the years we have customized the rules and scoring rules and this app uses our customized rule set.

## What's that name??

The name SplitnAss refers to one of the typical scoring rules we use: `Gespaltener Arsch` - the literal english translation being `split ass/arse`.  ;-)
